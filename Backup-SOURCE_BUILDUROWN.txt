Download Codeblocks, include a compiler ( codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe ) because I can't figure out how to add one to it.
Or any coding environment program for that matter.

Install Codeblocks

Open Codeblocks

Hit Create a new project

Choose Console application, click Go

Hit Next and choose C
MAKE SURE ITS NOT C++ CAUSE THIS IS C CODE OK

Title it like Backup or something

Bam make it

On the left pane click the + next to Sources

Double click on main.c

paste in the source code

Click the cog at the top

Copy the Backup.exe from ProjectName\bin\Debug

Paste it to wherever you want with the accompanying required files
Backup_destinationLocale.txt
Backup_saveLocales.txt

And put words in those files, open Backup.exe and you did it all good job
