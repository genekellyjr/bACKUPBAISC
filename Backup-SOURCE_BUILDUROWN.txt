This is gonna be real quick and msotly from memory (looked up some commands tho)

Download Rust, install it

Open cmd.exe

use 
	cd C:\Directory\Where\You\Want\The\Program\To\Build
hit enter

Type 
	cargo new Backup --bin
hit enter

Put the "Cargo.toml" file in that folder and replace the old one

You'll see a src folder
Put the "main.rs" file in that folder and replace the old one

Open cmd.exe again and/or (if still open) use
	cd C:\Directory\Where\You\Want\The\Program\To\Build\Backup
And then type
	cargo build --release

And you'll find the program in ..\Target\Release\Backup.exe
